# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
Before deploying code to a physical robot, we must simulate it. This module covers **Physics Simulation** and **Environment Building**.

## Learning Objectives
- Simulate physics, gravity, and collisions in **Gazebo**.
- Achieve high-fidelity rendering and interaction in **Unity**.
- Simulate sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Gazebo
an open-source 3D robotics simulator. It enables you to simulate robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.

### 2. Unity
A game engine used for high-fidelity visualization and Sim-to-Real transfer setups.

### 3. Sensor Simulation
Replicating real-world noise and data formats for Cameras and LiDARs to train robust AI models.

## Weekly Breakdown
- **Week 6-7**: Gazebo setup, SDF/URDF, Sensor Simulation.
