# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
This module focuses on the **middleware for robot control**. You will learn how to build the nervous system of a robot using **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)**.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services.
- Bridge Python Agents to ROS controllers using `rclpy`.
- Understand **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Nodes and Topics
The fundamental building blocks of ROS 2. Nodes perform computation, and Topics are the channels they use to communicate.

### 2. Services and Actions
Synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns for request/response and goal-oriented behaviors.

### 3. URDF
The XML format used to describe the physical properties of your robot (links, joints, inertia).

## Weekly Breakdown
- **Week 3-5**: ROS 2 Fundamentals, Architecture, Building Packages with Python.
